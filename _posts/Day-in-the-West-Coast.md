Spendin' all my days on the Eastside [of the bay], Oh! As my third week in the San Francisco Bay area comes to a close I can't say that I am forgetting who I was on the other side, but I have definitely been experiencing a lot of growth. the "other side" refering to my hometown, Lynn, Massachusetts. That is a distance of 3098 miles, 3 timezones, a six hour flight that I endured and as of three weeks ago I decided that it was well worth it. The best part is that this is is only the beginning.

<h3>Why I'm here</h3>

I don't wont focus on my backstory for this post, I will leave that for another post perhaps. Let's focus on the why. I moved across the country from my family and friends because I've always wanted to gain super powers. I was seeking a specific power though, one that has the potential to change the world, affecting millions. That is exactly what I have found in the East Bay and in what I believe to be the best possible way, a coding bootcamp by the name of <a href="http://www.telegraphacademy.com/">Telegraph Academy</a>. My goal is to be a badass software engineer, a person with the power to create anything they can conjure up in their imagination, a construct with the potential to touch an immesuarable number of people. I can proudly say that I have made significant progress towards that goal I have grown as a person and it is all thanks to the staff here at TGA along with the great group of students that they have gathered.

<h3>Fellow classmates</h3>

The only reason why I had a roof over my head when I landed in Oakland was actually thanks to one of my classmates, whom I am enternally grateful to. I came in expecting to meet a bunch of weirds that spent their days locked up in their parents basement trying to hack into the pentagon for fun, but I could not have been anymore wrong and I loved it. Our class ranges from stock traders and former med student, to semi pro basketball players and even some that can't tell us what it was that they did because we do not have the proper clearence to know. It's a very social group of people not what one would think of when they hear the word coder. Everyone brings something different to the tribe and it's awesome, I don't think I could have asked for a better cohort.

<h3>The staff</h3>

Telegraph Academy is a sister school to the famed Hack Reactor, founded by two Hack Reactor alumni, Albrey Brown and Bianca Gandolfo with the purpose of creating world-class software engineers out of those that are under represented in the industry. I am a student in the schools second cohort, with the first graduating just a week before I arrived in the state. they have assembled a great staff containing some of the alumni from the first cohort and others including the lead instructor Preston Parry. Preston is another Hack Reactor alumni and the man is an indispensible resource for TGA. It is easy to make the mistake of thinking that the material covered in class is simple just because of Prestons teaching prowess, the could probably teach a monkey to code. The rest of the staff is great, they help create a great environment with the students, it kind of feels like one huge family. 

<h3>Closing</h3>  

This post doesn't even scratch the surface of what TGA has done for me both as a person and as an engineer, I'm glad that I still have 10 weeks to go. I will start showing off my gained knowledge with my following posts.
